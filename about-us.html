    <h1>Well, hello!</h1>

    <p>Welcome to -Website Name-!
        <br><br>We created this website as way to help the average consumer affordably transition to a more sustainable lifestyle. 
        <br><br>As recent college grads, we know how difficult it can be to live sustainably and ethically. 
        There is so much information to sort through! It is hard to track and find ethical companies. 
        And when you do, the options presented may not seem realistic due to the cost or other factors.
        <br><br>That's where -Website Name- comes in. <!--insert superhero emoji-->
        <br><br>-Website Name- is a compilation of resources made to demystify the process of going green and living a more sustainable and ethical life.
        Our goal is to educate you so that you can make the best decisions for yourself, and to provide you with the information you need for understanding sustainable living.
        <br><br>You will see that a sustainable lifestyle is an entirely reachable goal! 
        We hope that this website helps you. If it does, please feel free to share!
